            Logitech G partners with many of the world's top esports athletes to design the PRO line with the goal of
            creating extreme performance gear that lets professionals play at the peak of their potential. The latest
            Logitech G PRO HERO Gaming Mouse has been updated with the new HERO 16K sensor and a low-friction, flexible
            cable. HERO 16K optical sensor is the highest performing and most efficient gaming sensor Logitech has ever
            made. An all-new lens and an updated tracking algorithm deliver ultra-precise tracking with no acceleration,
            smoothing, or filtering over the entire DPI range. Mechanical Switches and a Spring Button Tensioning system
            provide the near instantaneous button actuation that pro gamers demand. Logitech LIGHTSYNC technology lets
            you easily customize brilliant RGB lighting from approximately 16.8 million colors, while six programmable
            button can be setup with custom commands for your favorite games. Ultra-comfortable and durable, PRO HERO
            Gaming Mouse is built and tested to perform for an incredible 50 million clicks—the equivalent of a pro
            gamer training 10 hours a day for five years.

            n esports, winning isn’t measured in meters or seconds but micrometers and milliseconds. When the stakes are
            at their highest, a single flick-and-click can be the difference between going home with $5k or with $500k.
            That’s why Logitech G created PRO. Enhanced with HERO, our most advanced gaming sensor, for the incredible
            speed and precision needed to win.
